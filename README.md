## Execution

You can run a sample simulation with the following commands.

```bash
make
./producer
./consumer # In another terminal
```

The Makefile creates 3 executables, main, producer, consumer.

Running main will start both producer and consumer (However it exits very quickly).

```bash
./main
```

## Output

* other.txt

Contains the contents of "file.txt" (In our case Beowulf).
